### How to Get Started

- Fork this repo to your Github and then clone the forked version of this repo

### Running the application

In order to run the application, firstly install the dependencies (if you haven't already done so)

```
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env.dev` configuration file in the root of your repository with the settings you'd like to run the application against for the development environment.
You can utilise the same settings specified in `.env` if you wish.

To run the application against different environments, please create a `.env.test` and a `.env.prod` in the root of the repository to specify configuration for these environments.


You can then add a new script to the scripts section of the `package.json` to run the script for your specific environment. For example, the script below will enable you to run against the production configuration.

```JavaScript
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/server.js",
  "start-prod": "NODE_ENV=prod node src/server.js",
  "test": "jest"
},
```


```

npm start-prod

```

### Running the Unit Tests

In order to run the unit tests run, firstly install the dependencies (if you haven't already done so)

```

```

Followed by:

```

```
